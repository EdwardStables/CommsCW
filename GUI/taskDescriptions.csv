Descriptions
"Operating without the presence of a jammer or a noisy channel. Due to the absence of any channel effects, the signal recieved at the output of the channel is, by definition, identical to that input to the channal. This then follows the demodulation and decoding process, resulting in exactly the same output message as was input. Please see the module descriptions for an exact breakdown of the modulation and demodulation process."
"The channel has AWGN causing the SNRin to be 30dB, as can be seen on the constellation diagram on the right, SNRin=30dB gives a variation about each of the initial contellation points, but the variation is minor and the decision device is able to easily map it back to its initial symbol. This gives a very low probability of error, and multiple simulations give a consistent 0% bit error rate. "
"As before, AWGN gives randomisation of the symbol placement around the initial symbol position on the constellation diagram. The variation is larger when compared to the SNRin=30dB diagram, but again there is a clear definition between each of the 4 symbols and the signal is easily mapped back, with a very low probability of error. "
"With equipowerful noise and signal the signal is heavily randomised. As can be seen on the diagram, there is no clear definition between the 4 symbols, this leads to a very high error rate, with the output being almost completely different to the input. "
"PlaceHolder"
"The jamming signal is modulated in an identical manner to the message signal. This is multiplied with the message at the 'jammer' block in the channel, however the power is increased to 10dB greater than the message power. This results in heavy distortion to the signal, with the message being completely unrecoverable. "
"Again the jamming signal is modulated in precisely the same manner as the message signal, this time differing in respect to the gold code used during modulation. Demodulation shows a marked decrease in the bit error rate. This demonstrates the effectiveness of spread spectrum communications, even though the jamming signal is 10dB more powerful than the message signal, spread spectrum techniques allow for a very small bit error rate, further error correction techniques could result in this being a completely 0% error system even in the precesnce of noise and jamming.
